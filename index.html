The application leverages a RESNET50 model architecture built with TensorFlow-Lite, achieving an impressive 89% accuracy in classifying objects from the ImageNet dataset across 10 predefined classes. By implementing CoreML framework for on-device inference, I ensured the application maintains efficient performance without requiring internet connectivity, making it highly practical for real-world use.
            The user experience was a key focus, as I designed an intuitive interface using Figma for prototyping and implemented it with Swift UIKit, creating a seamless and engaging user interaction. This project showcases my ability to combine advanced technologies like machine learning with practical mobile development, while maintaining a strong focus on user experience and performance optimization.

          <p><strong>Graduate Salary Prediction using Machine Learning </strong></p>
         
            <p>
              As part of the Data Intensive Computation course, I engineered a machine learning pipeline to predict graduate salaries, incorporating variables such as educational background, work experience, and geographical location. The project involved extensive data preprocessing, including data imputation, normalization, and handling missing values to ensure high-quality inputs. Feature engineering techniques, such as one-hot encoding and polynomial transformations, were applied to better capture non-linear relationships among features. I employed advanced regression models, including linear regression, decision trees, and random forests, to optimize predictive accuracy and minimize overfitting.

              Additionally, I performed rigorous exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualized key salary trends using Seaborn and Matplotlib. The analysis allowed me to identify the most influential predictors and uncover patterns in the data, guiding feature selection. To enhance model robustness, I utilized cross-validation techniques, hyperparameter tuning via grid search, and performance metrics like RMSE and R². The final model was validated on unseen data to ensure generalizability, enabling accurate predictions for real-world applications. The project strengthened my expertise in Python, machine learning libraries such as Scikit-learn, and SQL for data extraction, along with performance tuning techniques for optimizing computational efficiency.

          <p><strong>Identifying Fake Products in the Supply Chain System </strong></p>
         
            <p>
              With reference to Dr. Bina Ramamurthy's research, I spearheaded the development of a blockchain-based decentralized e-commerce application focused on combating counterfeit products in supply chains. The system leverages Solidity smart contracts deployed on Ethereum to create an immutable record of product authenticity, while React provides an intuitive frontend interface for stakeholders to track and verify products throughout the supply chain journey7. The integration of MetaMask enables secure user authentication and transaction signing, while the NoSQL database efficiently handles both on-chain and off-chain data storage, ensuring optimal performance for large-scale supply chain operations12.
              The application's architecture incorporates a sophisticated Bonafide token system that facilitates secure and transparent transactions while maintaining a comprehensive audit trail of product movements. By utilizing distributed ledger technology, the system creates an unalterable record of each product's journey from manufacturer to consumer, with real-time verification capabilities10. The implementation of smart contracts automates compliance checks and transaction validation, while the NoSQL database's flexible schema accommodates the dynamic nature of supply chain data, enabling efficient querying and storage of product authentication records8. This technical approach significantly enhances supply chain transparency and effectively mitigates the risk of counterfeit products entering the distribution network.
